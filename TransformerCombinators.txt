Parser combinators on transformations.
The idea seems to work quite well. It's weird the relation between andThen and ~ (sequencing). In fact, ~ is a special case of function concatenation.
Parser t = Input -> ParseResult t = {more or less} Input -> (Option t, Input).
Now, ~ runs the second parser on the result of the first. If we consider a Parser as a function Input -> m Input, where m is a writer monad where the state is a suitable monoid (producing tuples with ~), we can say that the parser concatenation operator ~ is just the same as function composition, only "in a suitable monad" (in fact, it's a special case of (>=>)).
To be more accurate, we need to consider the Kleisli category of this suitable Writer monad; there function composition is defined exactly by (>=>) (as mentioned in Typeclassopedia).
Moreover, I should prove that ParseResult is also a monad.
